          "text": "For a moment, let's talk about motivation. It requires some motivation to go through 30 days of big changes to your life - what you're doing now. So, it's important to ask how motivation works. </br>Often in psychology, we break motivation into two types: avoidance motivation, and approach motivation. </br>Avoidance motivation comes from our desire to avoid some harm, discomfort, suffering. For our purposes that would be something like 'I want to reduce my smartphone use because scrolling for 4 hours makes me feel anxious. </br>Approach motivation comes from our desire to bring about something positive in our own lives or in the lives of our loved ones, communities, or some greater good. That's what we're focusing on right now. We want to ask 'By reducing our smartphone use, what positive things might I enable or reconnect with?' What are we approaching? </br>Neither of these motivational framings is right or wrong or better. However, I've found most people take the avoidance motivation approach ONLY. Why not make use of both? Let's reduce the harm of the attention economy AND use that extra time we've freed up on things we love! We're going to call these things we're APPROACHING, Cherished Goals (drawing from the Recovery Oriented Cognitive Therapy tradition)",
