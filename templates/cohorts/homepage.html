        <p class="qa-question">What made you build this?</p>
        <p class="qa-answer">Two reasons. First, I felt the attention economy pull me away from the things I love first hand and felt powerless to do anything about it. 
        Second, when I studied this issue and actually made progress, I realized that things could be changed and improved and I needed to share this with others.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="qa-card">
        <p class="qa-question">What did you learn?</p>
        <p class="qa-answer">
        Over the last five years, I've learned that attention isn't JUST something to harness for productivity bros. 
        <strong>Attention is the foundation of love.</strong> Where we place it shapes our 
        relationships, our hobbies, and the meaning we experience in our finite lives. 
        Also, it's way more flexible than I'd ever imagined. We can cultivate our attentional habits and put our attention where we truly desire.
        It may be hard at first, but it get's easier and you can truly love and be proud of how you attend to life.

    <article class="qa-card">
        <p class="qa-question">Who is this for?</p>
        <p class="qa-answer">
        I created this cohort for anyone who feels that same longing not just to disconnect from tech but to reconnect to the things we love. It's my best attempt at a research-informed,
        values-first way to reorient our attention and return it to the things that actually 
        make life fun and meaningful. This is very much a labour of love; I'm still doing this work alongside you.

<h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div style="max-width: 700px; margin-inline: auto;">

<!-- COST -->
<sl-details summary="How much does the cohort cost?">
    <p>
    The first cohort is <strong>free.</strong> Future cohorts will be paid with an optional "scholarship" program for people who justifiably cannot afford the cost.
    </p>
    <p>
    Paying an amount that feels meaningful to you can act as a
    <strong>commitment device,</strong> a well-studied psychological tool that increases
    follow-through by adding a small, self-chosen stake in the process.
    </p>
</sl-details>

<!-- QUITTING -->
<sl-details summary="Do I have to quit my phone or social media?">
    <p>
    No. You don't have to quit anything — but you <em>will</em> change how you use it.
    Instead of deleting your accounts or going "cold turkey," you'll
    <strong>dumb down your phone</strong> and redesign your feeds and defaults so they stop
    pulling you in automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
    The goal isn't abstinence. It's creating an environment where your phone feels like
    a just another digital tool again.
    </p>
</sl-details>

<!-- FAILURE / DISCIPLINE -->
<sl-details summary="What if I've already tried reducing my screen-time and it didn't stick?">
    <p>
    Most "cold turkey" plans don't work long-term. This cohort uses
    <strong>science-based nudges</strong> to redesign your digital environment so it's less
    addictive by design.
    </p>
    <p>
    And if you've relapsed before, that's normal. I've been working on my own screen-time
    for five years, and progress came with plenty of ups and downs.
    </p>
</sl-details>

<sl-details summary="What if I slip back into old habits after the cohort?">
    <p>
    Everyone slips, especially when tired, sick, or stressed. It's normal.
    You can revisit the cohort, refine your habits, or restart at any time.
    Perfection isn't the point. If you get 20 good days out of 30, that's 20 more good days than if you hadn't tried at all.
    </p>
</sl-details>

<!-- THE PROCESS -->
<sl-details summary="Will I have to change all my apps, settings, and devices?">
    <p>
    No. You can pick and choose what works for you. 
    But the more interventions you implement, the stronger the results tend to be.
    </p>
</sl-details>

<sl-details summary="Do I need special tools or paid apps?">
    <p>
    Nope. We recommend a few free apps and browser extensions, but nothing paid or technical
    is required.
    </p>
</sl-details>

<!-- PERSONALIZATION -->
<sl-details summary="What if I don't know what I value or don't have hobbies?">
    <p>
    That's completely fine. The entry exercises help you clarify what feels meaningful even
    if it's been years since you last felt connected to a hobby or project.
    </p>
    <p>
    And if nothing comes to mind, this is a perfect moment to explore something new.
    You might discover a lifelong passion.
    </p>
</sl-details>

<sl-details summary="What if my screen-time is already pretty low?">
    <p>
    You can still benefit. When I did my own 50-day experiment, my phone use was already under
    an hour a day but removing YouTube, Netflix, podcasts, and passive media from my other devices opened up a
    surprising amount of space.
    </p>
    <p>
    This cohort isn't just for going from overwhelmed to okay, I hope it can help you go from okay to
    flourishing too.
    </p>
</sl-details>

<!-- COMMUNITY -->
<sl-details summary="Do I have to join the Discord or get an accountability buddy?">
    <p>
    Nope. Community is optional. You can also do the cohort with a friend or loved one 
    they can be your accountability buddy even if they're not in the Discord.
    </p>
</sl-details>

<!-- PRIVACY -->
<sl-details summary="Will other people see my reflections or data?">
    <p>
    Absolutely not. Your data is <strong>anonymized</strong>, never shared, and you can delete
    it whenever you want. Your reflections stay private unless <em>you</em> choose to share them.
    </p>
